Tutorial 4 - Lighting Models

If you look in the Tutorial 3 Shader Graph folder, you will find my lighting shader, which includes all three lighting models sectioned clearly into groups. You can also find the materials in the Tutorial 4 Materials folder, where you can edit them and see changes in the game objects in real time. The game objects and directional light should all be in samplescene.
